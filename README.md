# Education

An online version of New Brunswick's **School Improvement Indicators** document.

Reasons for being:
- more accessable
- simpler to use
- single source of truth (ie. one update and everyone's document is updated)

## Build and Run
For `single-file`, open in any web browser
For `www`,
- locally: run `node test-app.js` and open to your localhost with displayed port
- web: see github static pages deployment process

## Navigating the project

### `single-file` directory

### `www` directory
A single-page HTML project designed for use on the web.
