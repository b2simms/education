        content: html`<p>The Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) cycle, or micro cycle, is a recursive cycle of activities that occurs within the school year (Deming, 1986)<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>. This cycle is contingent on the use of data/evidence to ensure progress toward ongoing improvement goals. Blink (2016) notes that &ldquo;school improvement is a continuous process&rdquo; (p.11)<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. It is important for schools to understand that the improvement planning cycle is recursive and the gathering of evidence and analysis of progress toward identified goals repeats within the school year.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is important for schools to use a variety of evidence to inform planning, including the examination of formative and summative assessments, to ensure their use of evidence/data is effective in identifying the strengths and challenges at all levels. Schools should prioritize high-impact strategies to promote ongoing growth, such as a focus on formative assessment and developing assessment capable learners. Schools could examine the links embedded below for information on balanced and formative assessment. It is recommended that teachers examine page 2 of the Formative Assessment link inserted below for information on the PDCA cycle and triangulation of data related to teaching practice.</p>

        <p>The New Brunswick School Improvement Indicators Document with Explanatory Notes suggests the following guidelines for monitoring of initiatives within the PDCA cycle. When discussing routine monitoring it states,</p>
        <p>&ldquo;although the school improvement plan is reviewed at the beginning and end of the school year, it is imperative that the strategies are monitored on a regular basis. It is suggested that minor interventions are monitored every 2 weeks and major interventions every 4-6 weeks to gauge their effectiveness and progression toward school goals. &ldquo;</p>
        <p>Recognizing that each school will have distinct goals and initiatives, these monitoring guidelines are suggestions. What is imperative is that teams use the PDCA cycle to regularly monitor progress and take action when the data indicates that progress toward identified goals is not occurring.</p>
        <p>School teams are cautioned that there may be an implementation lag when enacting a new program or process. Schools should not abandon an initiative if the initial examination of evidence/data does not indicate growth, but continue to monitor progress and analyze evidence/data to ensure that the program or process is being implemented with fidelity and that it is showing the intended results once staff become familiar and adept with the process. If ongoing analysis of evidence/data indicates that there is little or no growth over two or more cycles of analysis, then school personnel should closely examine the evidence/data to determine if there are issues with the process, the clientele, or the implementation, and make the necessary adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are several key timeframes for activities within the PDCA. Sample cycles are provided as guidelines. The graphics inserted below delineate some of the suggested actions and recommended timeframes for activities.</p>
        <p>The first graphic outlines the PDCA cycle. The second provides some suggested timelines and activities that schools may use to help guide their self-assessment and planning processes.&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
        <li>An improvement committee to oversee the school improvement process is established, or the committee membership from the previous school year is reconfirmed.</li>
        <li>Schools use evidence/data (conversations, observations and products) to identify potential areas of focus.</li>
        <li>Schools may use the guiding questions for each of the four domains outlined in the indicator document to assess their performance, prioritize domains, and identify target areas for improvement.</li>
        <li>Schools determine areas of focus, identify goals and associated strategies and actions to address areas for improvement, and identify links to the district and provincial education plans.</li>
        <li>Information from progress monitoring is shared with students, school, staff, stakeholders and partners on an ongoing basis.</li>
        <li>Districts request updates on progress to monitor performance and help schools identify challenges and source needed supports.</li>
        <li>During the January SIP session, schools will assess their performance across any or all four domains as outlined in the improvement plan. During this process, School Improvement Planning Teams will participate in a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; using targeted data and evidence to identify progress toward identified goals. They will then author the Annual School Performance Report.</li>
        <li>The Annual School Performance Report will be shared with district personnel. These will identify school goals, progress toward these goals, and identified PL needs to promote ongoing improvement (see the template provided in %LINK_10% for details).</li>
        <li>The process culminates in the generation and distribution of the Annual School Performance Report, noted above, and will inform the identification of long-term (yearly and multi-year) goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In order to ensure that the high-level data is shared from school, to districts and then to the province, and is used to inform long-term provincial planning and fiscal priorities, it is imperative that Annual School Performance Reports be completed during the January professional learning day which is focused on improvement planning</strong>. This school data, in aggregate, is shared with the districts, collated at the district level, and subsequently shared with the province on or before February 1<sup>st</sup>. District and department personnel will continue to collect additional evidence that informs implementation decisions and the allocation of supports.</p>`,

        content: html`<p>Research has identified that schools improve when they use a collection of data/ evidence (demographic, perception, student learning and school process) derived from a variety of sources (conversations, observations and products) to inform their goal-setting and decision-making processes (Bryk, Gomez, Grunow and LeMahieu, 2015<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>; Reeves, 2007<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>; DuFour, Dufour and Eaker, 2005<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>). The gathering and use of this evidence is a continuous process designed for the adoption of strategies to best meet changing student, school and systemic needs.</p>
        <p>Schools and districts may choose to adopt a one, two, three or four-year timeframe for long-term planning. A sample three-year planning cycle is provided in the table on the following page. It is recommended that the cycle be managed by each school and district to best address their particular needs and contexts. Because the Annual School Performance Report is used to inform systemic needs within a fixed budgetary process timeline, the self-assessment and reporting is slated to occur each January. Each school will be asked to identify long-term goals which will be supported by the strategies and actions outlined in the annual plan.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Annual improvement plans should be agile, with adjustments to strategies and actions being made within the school year which are informed by the ongoing monitoring process (Breakspear, 2017)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>. Once a goal has been reached and a practice embedded, this strategy could become part of a work plan rather than a targeted improvement initiative. When walkthroughs and/or other evidence indicates a decline in effective practice or the need to revisit a strategy or action, it may then be reinserted into the plan as needed. For example, a school with an effective Response to Intervention (RTI) strategy may need to revisit PL in this area if there is a sufficient staff turnover to warrant additional training. In the case of a significant change in staff or student clientele, it may be necessary for an extensive revision of the short-term strategies and actions used by a school. For example, a sudden and pronounced influx of newcomers may necessitate that schools re-examine their priorities.</p>
        <p>At the end of each cycle, prior to authoring the Annual School Performance Report in January, each school should do a complete self-assessment using the indicator document as a guide to identify the preferred standard. Following is a brief overview of the purpose for the instrument as well as a primer on using the instrument to self-assess effectively.&nbsp;</p>
