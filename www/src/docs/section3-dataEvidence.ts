The variety of data/evidence must be collected and analyzed on a regular basis. The key to the collection of the data/evidence is determining how the information relates to school improvement and improved student outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Blink notes that, &ldquo;the most important things to remember about the collection of data is that someone needs to be in charge&rdquo; (2016, p.18). In the absence of a responsible individual or team skilled in the use and application of data/evidence, schools should source support and/or PL opportunities to assist with gathering, analysis and application of data to build capacity. Further, every person involved in the collection and use of data should understand what they are responsible for and their role in the improvement process.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DuFour et al, (2005) and Reeves (2009)<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> have both been noted as identifying the problem of being &ldquo;data rich and information poor.&rdquo; All data/evidence should serve a specific purpose. If you are taking pains to collect the data/evidence, then you should work to analyze and act on the results. If you are not acting on the data/evidence, then it is likely that it was not worth collecting.</p>
        <p>If school leaders are unsure about their proficiency with data/evidence, it is recommended that they source district support. District personnel could work with school leaders and teams to examine the following factors and provide support where deemed appropriate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Team readiness.</li>
        <li>Identifying data/evidence sources.</li>
        <li>Analysis of evidence.</li>
        <li>Making hypotheses and identifying issues.</li>
        <li>Prioritizing and setting improvement goals.</li>
        <li>Designing objectives and strategies.</li>
        <li>Progress monitoring and evaluation.</li>
        <li>Implementation: making a commitment and planning for &ldquo;roll out&rdquo; (Blink, 2016, p. 26).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If teams are unsure whether they are effectively using evidence informed decision making, then they should examine whether data/evidence is effectively translating into changes in practice at the school and classroom levels.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finally, it is important when using data/evidence to ensure that the team identifies a Present Level of Performance (PLOP). This provides a baseline so teams are able to accurately identify whether they are making progress toward identified goals. The easiest ways to effectively establish a PLOP and monitor progress is to identify baseline measures when first implementing a strategy or when establishing a goal. The essence of creating effective goals and effectively monitoring progress is that it allows teams to not only plan and implement actions strategically but also promotes the importance of close monitoring to ensure teams are moving in the right direction towards achieving the desired results. The cycle for monitoring progress should occur on a regular and ongoing basis throughout the school year.&nbsp;</p>
