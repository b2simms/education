        content: html`<p>The indicator document is used at three different levels of the education system for different purposes.</p>
        <p>The indicator document is used as a means to identify the <em>highest standards of effective practice </em>for schools based on research.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The indicator document is used as a means to identify the preferred standards for schools and makes links to our current provincial strategy document, the 10-year Education Plan.</p>
        <p>At the school level, the indicator document is to be used to promote effective self-assessment. The document can be used to assist schools in identifying strengths and potential areas of focus. Ultimately, and most importantly, it is a mechanism to assist schools to identify and adopt practices which will help improve academic, behavioural, and social-emotional outcomes for students.</p>
        <p>At the district level, it is used to help determine areas where schools are focusing their energies and can be used to identify areas where additional resourcing or PL support may be needed.</p>
        <p>At the provincial level, it is used as a vehicle to help understand and inform how well we are doing systemically; the challenges that schools and districts are working to address; and, budgetary processes to allow for effective long-term planning, including informing allocation of resources and PL planning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The results from the Annual School Performance Reports will be collated at the district level and shared with the department at a high level. No school-specific identifying information will be shared. Results will be used to help determine progress toward the objectives outlined in the 10-year Education Plan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is important to reiterate that an annual review of the framework and indicator documents, based on current research, will be conducted to ensure ongoing alignment with changing systemic needs. These annual reviews will include input from each of the districts and will include representation from each of the district staffs, school-based administrative teams and teachers.</p>`,

        content: html`<p>To ensure understanding at all levels we have broken down the self-assessment process into seven steps. The School Improvement Planning &ldquo;SIP Self-Assessment Process Infographic&rdquo; outlines the seven steps. If school personnel feel they want to examine the process in its entirety they can go to the %LINK_11%.</p>
        <p>A general overview of the self-assessment process as follows. Prior to authoring the %LINK_12%, schools will use the indicator document to self-assess.</p>
        <p><u>If a school is in the first year of the improvement planning process</u>, they should examine the indicator document in its entirety to determine priority domains and areas of focus. Each domain includes guiding questions to assist schools to effectively identify target domains and potential areas for growth.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Other data should be examined to support analysis. This could include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>assessment results (formative and summative);</li>
        <li>Teacher Perception Survey Data results;</li>
        <li>Our School data;</li>
        <li>previous Improvement Plans/PLWEP documents;</li>
        <li>student profiles;</li>
        <li>behaviour tracking data;</li>
        <li>PLP analysis;</li>
        <li>lesson plans;</li>
        <li>team meeting minutes;</li>
        <li>teacher/team growth plans;</li>
        <li>technology plans;</li>
        <li>website analysis; and,</li>
        <li>data dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note data dashboards or e-binders may be used to assist schools to effectively organize and assess data. When used effectively, data dashboards can help schools be proactive by identifying potential problems and offering interventions before they affect student achievement. In some cases, the introduction of data dashboards and their associated reports helped facilitate schools&rsquo; shift to comprehensive data analysis and continuous school improvement. Suggestions for the effective gathering and use of data/evidence are shared in the following section.</p>
        <p>Once target areas for growth are identified, the Improvement Team may follow the recommended steps outlined on page 8 which include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>analyzing and assessing data/evidence to determine areas of focus;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>developing targeted goals for each area of focus;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>establishing actionable strategies based on data/evidence;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>communicating the plan;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>implementing actions;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>monitoring progress on an ongoing basis; and,&nbsp;</li>
        <li>adjusting strategies and actions as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>If school teams are using the document to determine progress toward previously identified goals</u>, (for example, they are in the second year of a two-year plan) they can be more targeted in their approach. In these cases, school teams may choose to focus on specific domains and indicators, and the associated measures already delineated in their current improvement plan to identify progress toward specific goals. This information should be analyzed along with a diversity of supporting data/evidence and can be used to provide content for the %LINK_13%. Regardless of where a school is in the process, a focus on using a variety of data/evidence to ensure an effective self-assessment occurs is recommended.</p>`,
