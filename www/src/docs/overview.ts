        content: html`<p>The desire for a consistent improvement planning framework for schools was identified by means of two major consultations.  The first was a consultation that focused on the 10-year Education Plan implementation.  The 10-year Education Plan implementation committee, which consisted of early childhood educators, representatives from the New Brunswick Teachers’ Association, First Nation educators, families, principals, classroom teachers, and education system leaders, led consultations with over 4800 participants. When the team submitted their recommendations, the overarching request from the system was to establish clear expectations for implementing the 10-year Education Plan.</p>
        <p>The second came from a system-wide consultation that occurred between the dates of November 24th and December 1st, 2017. This took into consideration the views of educators working on the front lines, and included 2497 individual and school submissions. Ongoing consultations, including focus groups and individual dialogues, have occurred regularly following the larger consultations. From these consultations, the desire for a consistent improvement framework, to be used provincially throughout the four Anglophone school districts was identified. Suggestions for content to be included in this framework were also gathered from these systemic consultations.</p>
        <p>Many New Brunswick public school policies indicate the responsibilities of school personnel and others to support effective planning practices. These policies include Policy 322 (Inclusive Education) and Policy 703 (Positive Learning and Working Environment), as well as the <em>Education Act</em> and its supporting regulations. Section 27(1) and section 28(2) of the Act requires that teachers and principals “assist in the development and implementation of the school improvement plan and [cooperate] in the preparation of the school performance report.” The content included in this document offers guidelines to assist schools to do this in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
        <p>Please see <a href="#_Appendix_G:_Policy">Appendix G</a> for an elaboration of the obligations associated with improvement planning in New Brunswick schools. </p>`,

        <ol>
        <li>improve systemic capacity to support the effective implementation of the provincial education plan;</li>
        <li>provide a document which outlines suggested guidelines which assist districts and schools to effectively plan to maximize academic, behavioural and social-emotional outcomes for students;</li>
        <li>provide a framework which balances school autonomy with systemic accountability; and</li>
        <li>collate high-level aggregate data via the Annual School Progress Reports, which will be completed during a provincial School Improvement Plan (SIP) planning day in January. The data from these reports will be shared from schools to the districts and then to the province to better support schools through more effective resource allocation and targeted identification of professional learning (PL) needs for the upcoming school year.</li>

        <p class="block">&ldquo;work toward developing a cohesive system that is effective and efficient. We must align programs and services, and promote collaborative planning and professional learning. Existing structures, practices and policies must be examined to ensure they are effectively supporting the needs and strengths of our learners&rdquo; (p.19).</p>

        <p>The framework is used to help align all of the components in a complex system.&nbsp; This will include a system-wide approach designed to ensure that we are collectively working to address the objectives outlined in the 10-year Education Plan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(See <a href="#_Appendix_A:_10-year">Appendix A</a> for a graphic outlining the objectives of the 10-year Ed Plan.)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The framework will assist districts working with their schools in identifying and working toward these objectives, and will support effective school planning while allowing schools the autonomy to address the specific and varied needs identified at the individual school level.&nbsp;</p>`,

        content: html`<p>Feedback from front line educators indicates that a self-assessment tool, based on the school review indicator document originally established by the New Brunswick School Improvement Service, will serve as the self-assessment instrument for use at schools. Schools and districts will use this document, along with school-based evidence (conversations, observations and products), as a mechanism to help identify their particular areas of focus for improvement. Schools and districts may also choose to use other tools to help support the identification of their distinct areas for growth.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that an annual review of the framework and the self-assessment tool will be completed to ensure ongoing alignment with current research and changing systemic needs. These annual updates will be done in consultation with districts and school personnel.</p>
        <p>Schools will be asked to submit an Annual School Progress Report to district representatives. This report will outline their strengths and potential areas for growth, as well as their progress toward reaching school goals. Districts will then submit a high-level document to the department outlining the areas of focus they believe need to be prioritized in their district, and suggestions for upcoming resourcing and professional learning needs.</p>`,

        content: html`<p>The framework is based on the following fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Student learning is at the center of the framework. All improvement plans should be focused on advancing student outcomes and working with students within their zone of proximal development to grow academically, behaviourally and socially-emotionally.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The data identified in school plans will be used to inform the district plan(s), which will then be used to drive provincial priorities.</li>
        <li>The indicator document (which will include links to the 10-year Education Plan objectives) will be used as an assessment tool to identify the highest standards of effective practice and will help schools identify baseline objectives.</li>
        <li>The framework will be used to assist schools to plan effectively. The individuality of the districts and schools will be valued.&nbsp; Schools will self-assess and identify their goals, associated strategies and actions based on their local school context, student profiles, staff capacity and what is relevant to address local needs. Autonomy on how these goals are reached will be based on local circumstances. It is recommended schools limit their global priorities to a manageable number.&nbsp; Research indicates that it is beneficial to establish a maximum of five school-wide goals in each improvement plan with three being the preferred number (Duke; Carr; Sterrett, and Wooleyhand, 2014, p.71).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
