		<p>This document is intended as a formative tool for fostering individual and collective professional growth. It will continue to evolve as new research becomes available and as we hear from you. It is a vehicle for introducing new concepts and initiating dialogue at planning tables, within professional communities and with school partners.</p>
		<p>This document is meant to challenge: to ensure every school is an inclusive environment where the diverse needs of 21<sup>st</sup> century learners are met.</p>
		<p>This document presents a synthesis of current research on school effectiveness. It is meant to be the core of the school improvement process - with your relevant performance data consistently pulled into the discussion to inform the analysis.</p>

		content: html`<p>The desire for a consistent improvement planning framework for schools was identified by means of two major consultations. The first was a consultation which focused on the 10-year Education Plan implementation. The 10-year Education Plan Implementation Committee, which consisted of early childhood educators, representatives from the New Brunswick Teachers&rsquo; Association, First Nation educators, families, principals, classroom teachers, and education system leaders, led consultations with over 4800 participants. When the team submitted their recommendations, the overarching request from the system was to establish clear expectations for implementing the 10-year Education Plan.</p>
		<p>The second consultation was system-wide and occurred between November 24th and December 1st, 2017. This took into consideration the views of educators working on the front lines and included 2497 individual and school submissions. Ongoing consultations, including focus groups and individual dialogues have occurred regularly following the larger consultations. From these consultations the desire for a consistent improvement framework to be used provincially throughout the four Anglophone School Districts was identified. Suggestions for content to be included in the Improvement Framework were also gathered from these systemic consultations. Ongoing dialogue with school, district and departmental personnel, accompanied by ongoing research, are used to inform the update of this document.</p>`,

		content: html`<p>This document may be used to assist schools in completing a school-based self-assessment of their processes and practices. Schools may choose to use this tool to assist them in the development of their Improvement Plans (e.g., School Improvement Plan (SIP) and Positive Learning and Work Environment Plan (PLWEP)) by guiding them through the process of identifying areas of focus and potential strategies.</p>
		<p>There are several approaches that schools and districts could take when using the indicator document. School personnel could perform a self-assessment using the indicators. They could choose to have an external team come into the school and evaluate school performance based on the indicators. Finally, schools and districts could adopt a blended model, whereby schools self-assess and seek support from other district personnel who work outside of, but in collaboration with, the school. These individuals are termed school liaisons or critical friends in the School Improvement Framework. School liaisons can either act as a critical friend who provides direct support, or they can link schools to others (district personnel, like-sized and configured schools, principal or teacher mentors/supports) who then act as the critical friend providing direct support. <u>It is recommended that this document be used primarily as a tool to assist schools to self-assess during their annual self-evaluations. It can also be used on an ongoing basis for self-reflection and to promote continual growth. </u></p>
		<p><strong>Recommended</strong> <strong>Process for Self-Evaluation:</strong></p>
		<p>School Improvement Teams can use the guiding questions at the beginning of each domain, in conjunction with school-based data (Teacher Perception Survey Data, Our School, meeting minutes, the existing SIP and PLWEP data monitoring), and other school, district and provincial data to determine areas of strength and initial areas of focus for growth.</p>
		<p>Once the initial areas of focus for growth are identified based on data and evidence, school teams are encouraged to drill down through the identified subdomains, indicators and sub-indicators, using explanatory notes and Inclusion Look-fors to support the rating of indicators and the selection of targeted areas for growth. The Inclusion Look-Fors, specify supports for specific individuals and groups. There are First Nations items that relate to all schools; not just schools with Enhancement Agreements. Every school has students who require PLPs and other extraordinary service delivery (Ability/Disability), and the reality of sexual minority populations is a universal that requires exploration and action in every school. School personnel should intentional in using this document to promote an inclusive environment for all. It is suggested that schools triangulate collected evidence to increase the reliability of the self-assessment. This should include teacher self-reflection, classroom observations, and objective analysis of both the structured and unstructured school day. Having targeted conversations with diverse members of the school community (teachers, admin staff, support staff, students, parents and other stakeholders as available) while viewing products (student work, lesson plans, meeting minutes, etc.) and formal processes would provide effective triangulation of data.</p>

		content: html`<p><strong>Schools can choose to use the ratings below when completing their self-analysis if it benefits the identification of school strengths and potential areas of focus for growth. When discussing indicator ratings, school teams are urged to be mindful of the purpose of this document as a vehicle for formative dialogue. The value of the discussion lies in coming to agreement on the current situation, and establishing priorities for focused action, not the rating.</strong></p>
		<p>The labels for the ratings are: <strong>Very <em>Evident (VE), Mostly Evident (ME), Somewhat Evident (SE) and Not Evident (NE)</em>.</strong></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 32px;"><strong>VE:</strong> You&rsquo;ve nailed it &ndash; keep maintaining the processes and knowledge needed to preserve this practice (embedded and consistent practice)</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 32px;"><strong>ME:</strong> You have processes and procedures in place and are partway there &ndash; don&rsquo;t slow down</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 32px;"><strong>SE:</strong> You have a plan and a step or two &ndash; decide whether it&rsquo;s a priority because it will take some dedication to implement</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 32px;"><strong>NE:</strong> You haven&rsquo;t considered it because you didn&rsquo;t think it was important, or don&rsquo;t know how to begin &ndash; you need some help to get started (<strong><u>if</u></strong> it&rsquo;s a priority)</p>
		<p>The following is proposed as a guide for determining ratings. Only <strong><em>Very Evident</em></strong> is defined. This approach was chosen in order to avoid inflexible rubrics while providing sufficient guidance to support uniform rating decisions.</p>
		<div style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 16px; padding: 0 16px;">
			<p><strong>Very Evident</strong></p>
			<p><strong><em>The evidence indicates that this look-for is consistently demonstrated, well-established, and sustainable (processes, </em></strong></p>
			<p><strong><em>knowledge, skills, data, and ongoing monitoring and adjustment are required for this to be in place).</em></strong></p>
		</div>

		<p><strong>Questions to consider when using a rating of <u>Very Evident</u>:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Is this part of the way we do business (pervasive, routine, part of the school culture)?</li>
			<li>Would this survive if the leadership changed?</li>
			<li>Is there a process for induction of new staff members?</li>
			<li>Is this a school-wide approach?</li>
			<li>Is it consistently demonstrated by staff &ndash; or just pockets of staff, or certain groups of staff?</li>
			<li>Is it documented with data and evidence or artifacts?</li>
			<li>Would your staff be able to explain/speak to this practice?</li>
			<li>Are staff members willing to share this practice with others or have others come to your school or class to observe?</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note: </strong>Indicators are rated by triangulating evidence from a variety of sources including observations, conversations and products.</p>
